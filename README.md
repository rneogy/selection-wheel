Code snippet for making a triggered selection wheel in web.

# about
This tool allows users to perform rapid gesture-based inputs with the mouse and keyboard to quickly change between tools. Specifically, in this example, users can hold shift to view the selection wheel, move their mouse in the direction of the option they desire, and release shift with their selection highlighted. The tool allows for visual aid in the often overbearing process of selecting tools in any interface, and is quickly learnable (at least in personal experience). This implementation utilizes HTML5 SVGs to create dynamic selection wheels that can easily adapt to the contents of an options array in index.js.

This tool was inspired by the ping/emote wheels in League of Legends and the item selection wheel in The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword.
